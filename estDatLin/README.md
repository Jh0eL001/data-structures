# Data Structures Practice in Java

This project is a collection of Java implementations for various data structures. It is designed to help practice and understand the fundamentals of data structures and their operations. Each folder in this repository focuses on a specific data structure, with corresponding `.java` files containing the implementation and examples.

## Current Structure

### Linked Lists

This folder contains implementations and examples of linked lists in Java.

- [DoublyLinkedList.java](/linked-lists/src/DoublyLinkedList.java): Implementation of a doubly linked list with basic operations like search, prepend, insertion and deletion.
- will be added soon:
- [CircularLinkedList.java](./CircularLinkedList.java): Implementation of a circular linked list where the last node points back to the head.

## Future Additions

More folders will be added to cover other data structures, such as:

- CircularLinkedList
- CircularDoublyLinkedList
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired folder.
3. Open the `.java` files in your favorite IDE or text editor to explore the implementations.
4. Compile and run the files to test the functionality.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests with new data structures or improvements to existing implementations.
